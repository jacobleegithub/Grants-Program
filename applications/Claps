### Overview

- Gamified health tracking app
- Claps is the mobile app that integrates gaming with personal health tracking can be a fun and engaging way to encourage users to track their health on a daily basis and make healthy lifestyle choices. The app could allow users to play games and record the results as a health diary, and reward them with incentives and rewards for completing diagnostic tests or answering questionnaires such as mood tracking.

Claps defines itself as a "gamified health tracking app" that uses gaming elements to motivate users to track their health and make healthy lifestyle choices. By integrating with artificial intelligence (AI) into a gamified health tracking app to provide a more personalized and interactive user experience.

AI algorithms are used to analyze users' health data and provide personalized recommendations for activities or behaviors that could help them achieve their health goals. The app AI can provide users with the option to request a consultation with a health practitioner if they are experiencing specific symptoms or are in need of support.

Claps is designed to be engaging and enjoyable to use, and could provide users with feedback and support to help them achieve their health goals. It could be a useful tool for promoting health and well-being, and could be particularly appealing to users who enjoy gaming and are looking for a more interactive and engaging way to track their health.

- By using Substrate technology to store and manage data, facilitate data sharing, dapps contracts, and create and manage digital assets such as NFT with patientâ€™s data. In the long-term, patients could potentially benefit from blockchain including in the areas of insurance and financial support. By leveraging the transparency, security, and efficiency of blockchain technology, patients could be better equipped to access the care and support they need.

- Taiwan Research-based Biopharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (TRPMA) is jointly established by 28 biopharmaceutical manufacturers and developers and 19 regenerative medicine companies based in Taiwan. This proposal is proposed by Jacob Lee, director of the digital health team at TRPMA. Jacob Lee is the co-designer of phrOS(Personal Health Records Operating System), a Ethereum private blockchain and IPFS Cluster based SaaS at Medical Center Hospital in 2017.

### Project Details

# Solutions
Personal Health AI Assistant

By integrating with Open AI technology,  AI assistants are designed to provide support and encouragement to individuals who may be struggling with health issues. The AI could provide individuals with the option to request a consultation with a health practitioner if they are experiencing specific symptoms or are in need of support.
Health Practitioners AI Assistant

AI algorithms can analyze individual patient data and provide personalized recommendations for treatment or care. This can help practitioners to tailor their approach to the needs of each patient and to make more informed decisions.
Web3 Technology

Web3 technologies can give individuals more control over their personal health records, as they can choose who has access to their data and when it is shared. This can help to enhance privacy and ensure that personal health information is used appropriately.

# Our Goals
Improve the quality of care and outcomes for patients.

- Chronic disease awareness and prevention
- Maternal and infant health
- Mental and behavioral health
- Nutrition, exercise and obesity prevention
- Alcohol, tobacco use and substance abuse

Claps enable patients to self-report, self-test, and access health education, and that incorporate AI-based features, can be a useful tool for improving the quality of care and outcomes for patients. By providing patients with the tools and support they need to manage their own health, these apps can help to empower patients and to improve the effectiveness of healthcare delivery.
Technology

- GPT-3 AI model
GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3) is a state-of-the-art language processing artificial intelligence developed by OpenAI. AI assistants are designed to provide support and encouragement to individuals who may be struggling with health issues.

### Ecosystem Fit

The pharmaceutical companies in this ecosystem can provide information to doctors, doctors provide consultation and health education to patients, and patients provide self-health tracking to doctors, could potentially be an effective way to improve the quality and accessibility of healthcare. In this model, the pharmaceutical company would be responsible for providing relevant and accurate information to doctors, who would then use this information to provide consultation and health education to patients. Patients would be responsible for tracking their own health and providing this information to doctors, which could help to inform treatment and care decisions.

## Future Plans

Open AI Integration

We are planning to integrate Open AI into Claps health mobile app in a second phase, after testing the market and gathering feedback. This approach allows us to minimize development costs and time in the first phase, while also gathering feedback and making sure that the features that we implement in the second phase are the most useful and needed.

Expand Substrate

We are planning to build an omnichannel platform for pharmaceutical companies and healthcare related based on Polkadot Substrate for expanding the ecosystem, providing a more secure and private way of data management, better interoperability, automation and improved healthcare education communication.
