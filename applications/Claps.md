### Overview

- Make self-care a fun game with Claps
- Claps is the mobile app that integrates gaming with personal health tracking can be a fun and engaging way to encourage users to track their health on a daily basis and make healthy lifestyle choices. The app could allow users to play games and record the results as a health diary, and reward them with incentives and rewards for completing diagnostic tests or answering questionnaires such as mood tracking.

Claps defines itself as a "gamified health tracking app" that uses gaming elements to motivate users to track their health and make healthy lifestyle choices. By integrating with artificial intelligence (AI) into a gamified health tracking app to provide a more personalized and interactive user experience.

The Claps AI is designed to support health practitioners in tracking patients' data on a daily basis. The AI algorithms analyze patients' health information and provide insights and recommendations to assist health practitioners in delivering personalized care to their patients. This can improve patient outcomes and help practitioners provide the most effective and efficient care.

Claps is designed to be engaging and enjoyable to use, and could provide users with feedback and support to help them achieve their health goals. It could be a useful tool for promoting health and well-being, and could be particularly appealing to users who enjoy gaming and are looking for a more interactive and engaging way to track their health.

- By using Substrate technology to store and manage data, facilitate data sharing, dapps contracts, and create and manage digital assets such as NFT with patient’s data. In the long-term, patients could potentially benefit from blockchain including in the areas of insurance and financial support. By leveraging the transparency, security, and efficiency of blockchain technology, patients could be better equipped to access the care and support they need.

- Taiwan Research-based Biopharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (TRPMA) is jointly established by 28 biopharmaceutical manufacturers and developers and 19 regenerative medicine companies based in Taiwan. This proposal is proposed by Jacob Lee, director of the digital health team at TRPMA. Jacob Lee is the co-designer of phrOS(Personal Health Records Operating System), a Ethereum private blockchain and IPFS Cluster based SaaS at Medical Center Hospital in 2017.

AI-powered alerts can help practitioners detect potential issues earlier and provide more proactive care. By providing tailored recommendations based on individual patient data, AI can also help practitioners make more informed decisions and provide personalized care.

Omni-channel

- This allows pharmaceutical companies to track and analyze the behavior and engagement of healthcare practitioners, patients, and other stakeholders, and make data-driven decisions about their marketing and communication strategies. These solutions can help pharmaceutical companies to make data-driven decisions about their marketing and communication strategies, which can help improve patient outcomes and the quality of care.

Web3 Technology

- Web3 technologies can give individuals more control over their personal health records, as they can choose who has access to their data and when it is shared. This can help to enhance privacy and ensure that personal health information is used appropriately.


# Our Goals
Improve the quality of care and outcomes for patients.

- Chronic disease awareness and prevention
- Maternal and infant health
- Mental and behavioral health
- Nutrition, exercise and obesity prevention
- Alcohol, tobacco use and substance abuse

Claps enable patients to self-report, self-test, and access health education, and that incorporate AI-based features, can be a useful tool for improving the quality of care and outcomes for patients. By providing patients with the tools and support they need to manage their own health, these apps can help to empower patients and to improve the effectiveness of healthcare delivery.

Technology

Substrate Blockchain

- By using Substrate blockchain technology to store and manage data, facilitate data sharing, dapps contracts, and create and manage digital assets with patient’s data. Leveraging Substrate blockchain technology for healthcare can offer significant benefits for patients and healthcare industry, providing them with enhanced privacy protection and better data consent management. By taking control of their own data, patients can access the care and support they need more efficiently and securely.

Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)

- Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) is a decentralized digital identity model that puts individuals in control of their personal information and how it is used. This approach to identity provides users with more privacy and control over their personal information, and helps to prevent data breaches and misuse of sensitive information.
Zero-knowledge proof
The zero-knowledge proof is part of SSI, this means that a user can prove their identity or access rights to a service without revealing any sensitive personal information. This helps to protect the privacy of the user and reduce the risk of data breaches, while still enabling secure and reliable authentication.

GPT-3 AI model

- GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3) is a state-of-the-art language processing artificial intelligence developed by OpenAI. The GPT-3 chatbots are designed to interact with patients on a daily basis to support and enhance the continued care work of health practitioners. It's always monitored by health practitioners to ensure the accuracy and relevance of their responses.

### Ecosystem Fit

The pharmaceutical companies in this ecosystem can provide information to doctors, doctors provide consultation and health education to patients, and patients provide self-health tracking to doctors, could potentially be an effective way to improve the quality and accessibility of healthcare. In this model, the pharmaceutical company would be responsible for providing relevant and accurate information to doctors, who would then use this information to provide consultation and health education to patients. Patients would be responsible for tracking their own health and providing this information to doctors, which could help to inform treatment and care decisions.

## Regulation and Compliance with HIPAA/GDPR

### Pseudonymization

By using pseudonyms, the health data can be processed and shared in a secure and de-identified manner, while still allowing for verifiable identification.

### End-to-end data encryption

Claps Health offers tools based on public key cryptography and AES256 GCM end-to-end data encryption to secure health data. Only authorized parties can access the data. The application layers are using AWS S3 industry compliance secure storage. 

### Audit logs

The auditable log of all access to the system, including who accessed it and what actions were performed
Consent Tracking

By implementing consent tracking smart contracts, organizations can demonstrate that they are following privacy regulations and that patients have control over their health data. 

### Right to be forgotten

Claps Health does not store personal data on the blockchain and there is only random ID and hash code on chain. Individuals have more control over their data and can request deletion of the corresponding data in the database. Ensure that all personal data is securely deleted and no residual information remains that could be used to re-identify individuals.

### However, it is important to note that HIPAA/GDPR compliance involves a comprehensive set of rules and regulations for protecting health information. This proposal does not cover all of the guidelines such as physical access, governance of organizations..etc.


## Future Plans

Open AI Integration

We are planning to integrate Open AI into Claps health mobile app in a second phase, after testing the market and gathering feedback. This approach allows us to minimize development costs and time in the first phase, while also gathering feedback and making sure that the features that we implement in the second phase are the most useful and needed.

Expand Substrate

We are planning to build an omnichannel platform for pharmaceutical companies and healthcare related based on Polkadot Substrate for expanding the ecosystem, providing a more secure and private way of data management, better interoperability, automation and improved healthcare education communication.
